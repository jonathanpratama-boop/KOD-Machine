# KOD paper account (PAPER_ACCOUNT_v1)

As of the latest record (2026-11-03T22:58:49Z). Paper only: no orders, no money. Protocol: `research/PAPER_ACCOUNT_v1/protocol.json`.

## The three plain answers

- **What does it do?** It takes KOD's BUY_OK spikes (and the ones you confirm) through the real execution rules with one shared $10,000 account per arm: 0.5% planned loss per position, 1.5% for everything at once, at most 3 new orders per session, no leverage. An order fills only at the next opening print inside its limit; stops and the five-session time exit come from the bars.
- **How to read the money:** cash is what the account holds; reserved is cash set aside for orders waiting for the next open (not spent, not lost, just unavailable to another order); available = cash minus reserved. Equity = cash plus open positions at their latest recorded price. Realized P&L counts only closed trades.
- **Two stops side by side:** BASE uses the spike day's low (the existing contract); FIXED5 puts the stop 5% below the fill. Same candidates, costs and exits. Each arm is a separate simulated account.
